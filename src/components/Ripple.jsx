      <h2>What is Ripple?</h2>
      <p>
        Ripple is a technology that acts as a cryptocurrency and digital payment
        network for financial transactions. It was first released in 2012 and
        was co-founded by Chris Larsen and Jed McCaleb. Ripple is a pre-defined
        currency called XRP.
      </p>
      <h2>Main Points</h2>
      <p>
        1. Ripple is a technology mostly known for its digital payment network
        and protocol, however, it also has its own cryptocurrency, XRP.
        <br /> 2. Ripple's main operation is an asset exchange and payment
        transfer system similar to the SWIFT system for international money
        transfers and security used by banks and financial intermediaries.
        <br /> 3. Instead of using blockchain mining, Ripple uses a consensus
        mechanism through a group of servers to confirm transactions.
        <br /> 4. Ripple transactions use less energy than Bitcoin, are
        confirmed in seconds and cost very little, versus Bitcoin transactions
        that use more energy, take longer to confirm and have higher transaction
        costs.
      </p>
      <h2>Understanding Ripple</h2>
      <p>
        Ripple is better known for its digital payment protocol than the
        cryptocurrency, XRP. Ripple operates on an open source and peer-to-peer
        decentralized platform that allows seamless transfer of funds in any
        form, be it USD, Yen, Litecoin or Bitcoin. To understand how the system
        works, consider the money transfer structure where the two parties to a
        transaction use their preferred intermediaries to send and receive
        money. Alex needs to send $100 to Michael who lives in a different city.
        His local agent, Kate, gives the money to send to Michael with a
        password that Michael must answer correctly to receive the money. Kate
        alerts Michael's agent, Rose, about the details of the transaction - the
        recipient, the money to be redeemed, and the password. If Michael gives
        Rose the correct password, Rose gives him $100. However, the money is
        coming from Rose's account which means Kate will owe Rose $100. Rose can
        either record all of Kate's debts or debentures that Kate will pay on an
        agreed day, or make corresponding transactions that will offset the
        debt. For example, if Rose is Martin's agent and Martin needs to
        transfer $100 to John whose agent is Kate, this will offset the $100
        owed to Rose, as John will be paid out of Kate's account. Although the
        Ripple network is a little more complex than this example, the example
        shows the basics of how the Ripple system works. From the example above,
        one can see that trust is required to initiate a deal â€“ a trust between
        Alex, Kate, Kate, Rose, Michael, and Rose. Ripple uses an intermediary
        known as Gateway that acts as a link in the chain of trust between two
        parties who wish to conduct a transaction. Gateway acts as a credit
        intermediary that receives and sends coins to public addresses across
        the Ripple network. Anyone or any company can register and open a portal
        that allows the registrant to act as a broker for currency exchange,
        maintaining liquidity and transferring payments on the network.
      </p>
      <h2>How does Ripple work?</h2>
      <p>
        The Ripple network does not work with a mining system like Bitcoin.
        Instead, transactions rely on a consensus protocol to verify account
        balances and transactions on the system. Consensus improves system
        integrity by preventing double spending. Ripple user who initiates a
        transaction using Gateway system but succeeds by sending $100 to
        multiple Gateway systems, all paired transactions except for the first
        transaction will be deleted. Individual distributed systems unanimously
        decide which transaction was made first by conducting a poll to
        determine a majority vote. Confirmations are instant and take about 5
        seconds. Since there is no central authority deciding who can set up a
        node and confirm transactions, the Ripple platform is described as
        decentralized. Ripple tracks all debt securities of any user or Gateway.
        and the transaction flows that occur between publicly available Ripple
        wallets in the Ripple transaction records. But even though the history
        of financial transactions is publicly recorded and made available on the
        blockchain, the data is not linked to any individual or company's
        account. The public record of all transactions, however, makes the
        information vulnerable to anonymizing measures.

      <h2>How to buy XRP?</h2>
      <p>
        Buying ether may seem complicated, but it is much easier when you break
        it down into steps. Buying Ethereum is getting easier day by day and the
        legitimacy of exchanges and wallets is also increasing.
      </p>
      <h4>The first step: choose the mediator</h4>
      <p>
        Registering with a cryptocurrency broker opens the door for you to buy,
        sell and hold cryptocurrencies. The best brokers also allow their users
        to withdraw their cryptocurrencies to their personal online wallet for
        safer keeping. For those who are looking to trade short term, this
        feature may not be important. Currently, the most popular brokers are
        Know-The-Customer (KYC). Brokers have greatly grown the features they
        offer. Brokers such as eToro offer the ability to own assets or buy
        currencies using futures contracts (CFDs) through FXCM. Other trading
        platforms exist, offering more trading functionality and more variety of
        altcoins to choose from but they are more complicated. An important
        thing to note when creating an account with a broker is to use a secure
        internet. This includes the use of (2FA) and the use of a unique and
        long password.
      </p>
      <h4>Step Two: Define the account</h4>
      <p>
        You are required to upload both Proof of Identity (POI) and Proof of
        Residence (POA). Your verification process will only start after you
        submit both documents. ID proof Your POI document should contain your
        name, date of birth, clear photo, date of issue, ID number or passport
        number, and if it has an expiration date, this should also be visible.
        The passport is the preferred proof of identity, as it is the document
        that will be the fastest in the verification process. Alternatively, you
        can use a driver's license or any other government identification. If
        the document is two-sided, and there is relevant information on the
        back, be sure to upload it as well. All information found should be
        visible. Proof of residence (address) Your power of attorney document
        must contain your full name, address and date of issue, which should not
        exceed 6 months. The name or logo of the issuer should also be clear.
        Please make sure to lift the document against a background of different
        colors, so that the four corners are visible. Your proof of address can
        be one of the following:
        <br /> 1. Bank statement <br />
        2. Credit Card Account Statement <br />
        3. Electricity, water or gas bill
        <br /> 4. A letter from the employer <br />
        5. A letter from your local municipality
        <br /> 6. Phone bill <br /> 7. Internet bill
      </p>
      <h4>Step Three: Connect Payment Option</h4>
      <p>
        After the broker establishes your identity and legitimacy, you can now
        connect the payment option. In most companies, you can link your bank
        account directly or you can link a credit card to purchase
        cryptocurrency. While Bitcoin is legal in most countries, some banks are
        not very kind to the idea and may question or even stop deposits at
        crypto-related sites. It is a good idea to check to make sure that your
        bank allows deposits with the broker you have chosen to deal with. It is
        important to research the fees associated with each payment option to
        help choose the payment option that is best for you. Brokers also charge
        a fee for each transaction. This fee can be either a flat fee or a
        percentage of the trading amount. Credit cards are subject to processing
        fees in addition to transaction fees.
      </p>
      <h4>Fourth Step: Submit the application</h4>
      <p>
        Once you choose the broker and connect the payment option, you can now
        buy Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. In recent years, cryptocurrency
        exchanges have become more and more popular. It has grown exponentially
        in terms of liquidity and breadth of features. The industry that was
        previously seen as a scam or an industry with questionable practices is
        slowly turning into a legitimate industry that has attracted the
        interest of all the big investors in the financial services industry.
        Now, cryptocurrency exchanges have reached a point where they have
        almost the same level of features as their counterparts in a traditional
        brokerage. Once you find a broker and deposit your investment, you are
        ready to start buying. Cryptocurrency exchanges today offer a number of
        order types and investment methods. Almost all cryptocurrency exchanges
        offer both market orders and limit orders, and some also offer stop-loss
        orders. Among the exchanges mentioned above, eToro offers the most order
        types. eToro allows market orders, limit, stop loss, stop limit, take
        profit and take profit *When you buy cryptocurrencies on the eToro
        platform, you own the assets. The only trading fees that eToro charges
        are the spreads. That is, there are no swaps fees. Cryptocurrencies can
        be transferred from the eToro platform to the eToro wallet. But it is
        better to keep them inside the platform if the goal of your trading is
        to take advantage of the high prices to sell in the future. Those who
        send to the wallet are usually those who want to use cryptocurrencies as
        a payment method.

      <h2>How to sell XRP?</h2>
      <p>
        You can sell XRP at the same places where you bought the cryptocurrency,
        such as cryptocurrency exchanges or individually. The process of selling
        XRP on these platforms is usually the same as buying cryptocurrency. For
        example, you may just be asked to click a button and select an order
        type (i.e. whether you want to sell the cryptocurrency immediately at
        the available prices or whether it should be sold to limit losses) to
        make the sale. Exchanges generally have daily and monthly withdrawal
        limits. Therefore, cash from a big sale may not be immediately available
        to the trader. However, there are no limits on how much cryptocurrency
        you can sell.
