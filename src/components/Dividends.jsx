      <h2>What is dividend distribution?</h2>
      <p>
        Dividends are the distribution of some of the company's profits to a
        class of its shareholders, as determined by the company's board of
        directors. Ordinary shareholders of companies that pay a dividend are
        usually eligible as long as they own the shares before the dividend
        date. Dividends can be paid in cash or in the form of additional shares.

        investors for putting their money into a project.

        Dividends carry important dates that determine whether or not
        shareholders will receive a dividend. First, the ex-dividend date is the
        last date on which eligibility to receive dividends expires, often
        occurring one business day before the filing date. Second, the standard
        date is when the board of directors determines which shareholders will
        receive the dividend, along with relevant financial information relating
        to the payment of the dividend.
      </p>
      <h2>Important dates for dividend distribution</h2>
      <p>
        <b>Announcement Date</b>: Dividends are announced by the company's
        management on the date of the announcement, and must be approved by the
        shareholders before they can be paid.
        <br />
        <b>Dividend Dividend Date</b>: The date on which the dividend payout
        expires is called the ex-dividend date or simply the ex-date. For
        example, if a stock has a date prior to Monday, May 5, the shareholders
        who buy the stock on or after that day will not qualify for the dividend
        because they buy it on or after the end date of the dividend.
        Shareholders who own the shares one business day before the previous
        date — that is, Friday, May 2, or earlier — will receive a dividend.
        <br />
        <b>Record Date</b>: The record date is the final date the company sets
        in order to determine which shareholders are eligible to receive
        dividends or distributions.
        <br />
        <b>Payment date</b>: the company issues the dividend payment on the date
        of payment, which is the date on which funds are deposited into
        investors' accounts
      </p>
      <h2>The effect of dividends on share price</h2>
      <p>
        Because dividends are irreversible, their payments usually take the
        money off the company's books and company accounts for good. Therefore,
        dividend payments affect the stock price - they may rise on the
        announcement by approximately the amount of the declared dividend and
        then decrease by a similar amount at the opening session of the previous
        dividend date.
