      <h2>What is bitcoin?</h2>
      <p>
        Bitcoin is a digital currency that was created in January 2009. By
        Satoshi Nakamoto that's his pseudonym. The identity of the person or
        people who invented this technology remains a mystery. Bitcoin promises
        lower transaction fees than traditional online payment mechanisms, and
        unlike government-issued currencies, it is operated by a decentralized
        authority. Bitcoin is a type of cryptocurrency. There are no tangible
        bitcoins, only balances kept in a "storage system" similar to a bank
        records database system. Which can be accessed transparently by
        everyone. All Bitcoin transactions are verified by a tremendous amount
        of computing power. Bitcoins are not issued or backed by any banks or
        governments, and individual bitcoins are not of value as a commodity.
        Although it is not affiliated with any regulatory body, bitcoin is very
        popular and has led to the launch of hundreds of other cryptocurrencies,
        which are collectively referred to as altcoins. Bitcoin is usually
        abbreviated to "BTC".

      <h2>Main points</h2>
      <p>
        1. Bitcoin was launched in 2009 and is the world's largest
        cryptocurrency by market capitalization. <br></br>2. Unlike fiat
        currencies, Bitcoin is created, distributed, traded and stored using a
        decentralized storage system known as a blockchain.<br></br> 3. As the
        first virtual currency to achieve widespread success and popularity,
        Bitcoin has inspired a host of other cryptocurrencies in its wake.
      </p>
      <h2>Bitcoin mining</h2>
      <p>
        Bitcoin mining is the process by which bitcoins are released into
        circulation. In general, mining requires solving computationally
        difficult puzzles in order to discover a new block, which is added to
        the blockchain. Bitcoin mining adds and verifies transaction records
        across the network. To add blocks to the blockchain, miners are rewarded
        with a few bitcoins; The reward is halved every 210,000 blocks. The
        block reward was 50 new bitcoins in 2009. On May 11, 2020, the third
        halving occurred, bringing the reward for each block discovery down to
        6.25 bitcoins. A variety of devices can be used to mine Bitcoin.
        However, some produce higher rewards than others. Some computer chips,
        called application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), and more
        advanced processing units, such as graphics processing units (GPUs), can
        bring in more bonuses. These elaborate mining processors are known as
        "mining rigs". One bitcoin can be divided into eight decimal places (100
        millionths of one bitcoin), and this smaller unit is referred to as a
        satoshi. If necessary, and if the participating miners accept the
        change, Bitcoin can eventually be made divisible by an even larger
        number. decimal places.
      </p>
      <h2>Investing in Bitcoin</h2>
      <p>
        There are many Bitcoin supporters who believe that digital currency is
        the future. Many people who support Bitcoin believe that it facilitates
        the payment system (much faster and at lower rates for worldwide
        transactions). Although not backed by any government or central bank,
        bitcoin can be exchanged for traditional currencies; In fact, its
        exchange rate against the dollar attracts potential investors and
        traders who are interested in currency trading. In fact, one of the main
        reasons for the growth of digital currencies such as Bitcoin is that
        they can act as an alternative to national money and traditional
        commodities such as gold. In March 2014, the IRS stated that all virtual
        currencies, including bitcoins, would be taxed as property rather than
        currency. Gains or losses from bitcoins held as capital will be realized
        as capital gains or losses, while bitcoins held as stock will incur
        normal gains or losses. Selling or buying bitcoins you've mined from a
        third party, or using bitcoins to pay for goods or services, are
        examples of taxable transactions. Like any other asset, the principle of
        buying low and selling high applies to bitcoins. The most popular way is
        to buy through platforms that sell bitcoins, but there are many other
        ways to earn and own bitcoins.
      </p>
      <h2>How to buy bitcoin</h2>
      <p>
        Buying bitcoins may seem complicated, but it is much easier when you
        break it down into steps. Buying bitcoin is getting easier by the day
        and the legitimacy of exchanges and wallets is also increasing.
      </p>
      <h4>The first step: choose the mediator</h4>
      <p>
        Registering with a cryptocurrency broker opens the door for you to buy,
        sell and hold cryptocurrencies. The best brokers also allow their users
        to withdraw their cryptocurrencies to their personal online wallet for
        safer keeping. For those who are looking to trade short term, this
        feature may not be important. Currently, the most popular brokers are
        Know-The-Customer (KYC). Brokers have greatly grown the features they
        offer. Brokers such as eToro offer the ability to own assets or buy
        currencies using futures contracts (CFDs) through FXCM. Other trading
        platforms exist, offering more trading functionality and more variety of
        altcoins to choose from but they are more complicated. An important
        thing to note when creating an account with a broker is to use a secure
        internet. This includes the use of (2FA) and the use of a unique and
        long password.
      </p>
      <h4>Step Two: Define the account</h4>
      <p>
        You are required to upload both Proof of Identity (POI) and Proof of
        Residence (POA). Your verification process will only start after you
        submit both documents. ID proof Your POI document should contain your
        name, date of birth, clear photo, date of issue, ID number or passport
        number, and if it has an expiration date, this should also be visible.
        The passport is the preferred proof of identity, as it is the document
        that will be the fastest in the verification process. Alternatively, you
        can use a driver's license or any other government identification. If
        the document is two-sided, and there is relevant information on the
        back, be sure to upload it as well. All information found should be
        visible. Proof of residence (address) Your power of attorney document
        must contain your full name, address and date of issue, which should not
        exceed 6 months. The name or logo of the issuer should also be clear.
        Please make sure to lift the document against a background of different
        colors, so that the four corners are visible. Your proof of address can
        be one of the following:
        <br /> 1. Bank statement <br />
        2. Credit Card Account Statement <br />
        3. Electricity, water or gas bill
        <br /> 4. A letter from the employer <br />
        5. A letter from your local municipality
        <br /> 6. Phone bill <br /> 7. Internet bill
      </p>
      <h4>Step Three: Connect Payment Option</h4>
      <p>
        After the broker establishes your identity and legitimacy, you can now
        connect the payment option. In most companies, you can link your bank
        account directly or you can link a credit card to purchase
        cryptocurrency. While Bitcoin is legal in most countries, some banks are
        not very kind to the idea and may question or even stop deposits at
        crypto-related sites. It is a good idea to check to make sure that your
        bank allows deposits with the broker you have chosen to deal with. It is
        important to research the fees associated with each payment option to
        help choose the payment option that is best for you. Brokers also charge
        a fee for each transaction. This fee can be either a flat fee or a
        percentage of the trading amount. Credit cards are subject to processing
        fees in addition to transaction fees.
      </p>
      <h4>Fourth Step: Submit the application</h4>
      <p>
        Once you choose the broker and connect the payment option, you can now
        buy Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. In recent years, cryptocurrency
        exchanges have become more and more popular. It has grown exponentially
        in terms of liquidity and breadth of features. The industry that was
        previously seen as a scam or an industry with questionable practices is
        slowly turning into a legitimate industry that has attracted the
        interest of all the big investors in the financial services industry.
        Now, cryptocurrency exchanges have reached a point where they have
        almost the same level of features as their counterparts in a traditional
        brokerage. Once you find a broker and deposit your investment, you are
        ready to start buying. Cryptocurrency exchanges today offer a number of
        order types and investment methods. Almost all cryptocurrency exchanges
        offer both market orders and limit orders, and some also offer stop-loss
        orders. Among the exchanges mentioned above, eToro offers the most order
        types. eToro allows market orders, limit, stop loss, stop limit, take
        profit and take profit *When you buy cryptocurrencies on the eToro
        platform, you own the assets. The only trading fees that eToro charges
        are the spreads. That is, there are no swaps fees. Cryptocurrencies can
        be transferred from the eToro platform to the eToro wallet. But it is
        better to keep them inside the platform if the goal of your trading is
        to take advantage of the high prices to sell in the future. Those who
        send to the wallet are usually those who want to use cryptocurrencies as
        a payment method.
      </p>
      <h2>How to sell bitcoin</h2>
      <p>
        You can sell bitcoins at the same places where you bought the
        cryptocurrency, such as cryptocurrency exchanges, or individually. The
        process of selling Bitcoin on these platforms is usually the same as
        buying cryptocurrency. For example, you may just be asked to click a
        button and select an order type (i.e. whether you want to sell the
        cryptocurrency immediately at the available prices or whether it should
        be sold to limit losses) to make the sale. Exchanges generally have
        daily and monthly withdrawal limits. Therefore, cash from a big sale may
        not be immediately available to the trader. However, there are no limits
        on how much cryptocurrency you can sell.
