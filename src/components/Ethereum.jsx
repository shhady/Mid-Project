      <h2>What is Ethereum?</h2>
      <p>
        Launched in 2015, Ethereum is an open source blockchain-based
        decentralized software platform used for its cryptocurrency, Ether. It
        enables SmartContracts and Distributed Applications (ƒêApps) to be
        created and run without any downtime, fraud, control or third party
        interference. Ethereum is not just a platform but also a Turing Complete
        programming language that runs on the blockchain, helping developers
        create and publish distributed applications.
      </p>
      <h2>Main Points</h2>
      <p>
        1. Ethereum is an open source computing platform and operating system.
        <br />
        2. It has its own cryptocurrency, ether. (Ether)
        <br /> 3. One of the big projects around Ethereum is Microsoft's
        partnership with ConsenSys.
      </p>
      <h2>Understanding Ethereum</h2>
      <p>
        Applications that run on Ethereum run on the platform's own
        cryptographic token, Ether. During 2014, Ethereum launched an initial
        sale of Ether which received an overwhelming response. Ether is
        considered as a way to navigate the Ethereum platform and is mostly
        sought by developers looking to develop and run applications within the
        Ethereum platform. Ether is widely used for two purposes: it is traded
        as a digital currency exchanger like other cryptocurrencies, and it is
        used within the Ethereum platform to run applications and even to
        monetize the business. According to Ethereum, it can be used to blog,
        decentralize, secure and trade anything. One of the big projects around
        Ethereum is Microsoft's partnership with ConsenSys which offers
        "Ethereum Blockchain as a Service (EBaaS) on Microsoft Azure so that
        Enterprise customers and developers can have a one-click cloud-based
        developer environment." In 2016, Ethereum was split into two separate
        groups, Ethereum and Ethereum Classic, after one of them stole more than
        $50 million in funds raised on the DAO, a suite of smart contracts that
        originated from the Ethereum software platform. The new Ethereum was a
        split from the original program with the aim of protecting against
        further attacks. As of September 2019, Ethereum was the second largest
        virtual currency in the market, after only Bitcoin. Getting ether is
        much faster and cheaper than getting bitcoin, and there are much more
        ether units in circulation than bitcoin.

      <h2>How to buy ethereum Coin (Ether)</h2>
      <p>
        Buying ether may seem complicated, but it is much easier when you break
        it down into steps. Buying Ethereum is getting easier day by day and the
        legitimacy of exchanges and wallets is also increasing.
      </p>
      <h4>The first step: choose the mediator</h4>
      <p>
        Registering with a cryptocurrency broker opens the door for you to buy,
        sell and hold cryptocurrencies. The best brokers also allow their users
        to withdraw their cryptocurrencies to their personal online wallet for
        safer keeping. For those who are looking to trade short term, this
        feature may not be important. Currently, the most popular brokers are
        Know-The-Customer (KYC). Brokers have greatly grown the features they
        offer. Brokers such as eToro offer the ability to own assets or buy
        currencies using futures contracts (CFDs) through FXCM. Other trading
        platforms exist, offering more trading functionality and more variety of
        altcoins to choose from but they are more complicated. An important
        thing to note when creating an account with a broker is to use a secure
        internet. This includes the use of (2FA) and the use of a unique and
        long password.
      </p>
      <h4>Step Two: Define the account</h4>
      <p>
        You are required to upload both Proof of Identity (POI) and Proof of
        Residence (POA). Your verification process will only start after you
        submit both documents. ID proof Your POI document should contain your
        name, date of birth, clear photo, date of issue, ID number or passport
        number, and if it has an expiration date, this should also be visible.
        The passport is the preferred proof of identity, as it is the document
        that will be the fastest in the verification process. Alternatively, you
        can use a driver's license or any other government identification. If
        the document is two-sided, and there is relevant information on the
        back, be sure to upload it as well. All information found should be
        visible. Proof of residence (address) Your power of attorney document
        must contain your full name, address and date of issue, which should not
        exceed 6 months. The name or logo of the issuer should also be clear.
        Please make sure to lift the document against a background of different
        colors, so that the four corners are visible. Your proof of address can
        be one of the following:
        <br /> 1. Bank statement <br />
        2. Credit Card Account Statement <br />
        3. Electricity, water or gas bill
        <br /> 4. A letter from the employer <br />
        5. A letter from your local municipality
        <br /> 6. Phone bill <br /> 7. Internet bill
      </p>
      <h4>Step Three: Connect Payment Option</h4>
      <p>
        After the broker establishes your identity and legitimacy, you can now
        connect the payment option. In most companies, you can link your bank
        account directly or you can link a credit card to purchase
        cryptocurrency. While Bitcoin is legal in most countries, some banks are
        not very kind to the idea and may question or even stop deposits at
        crypto-related sites. It is a good idea to check to make sure that your
        bank allows deposits with the broker you have chosen to deal with. It is
        important to research the fees associated with each payment option to
        help choose the payment option that is best for you. Brokers also charge
        a fee for each transaction. This fee can be either a flat fee or a
        percentage of the trading amount. Credit cards are subject to processing
        fees in addition to transaction fees.
      </p>
      <h4>Fourth Step: Submit the application</h4>
      <p>
        Once you choose the broker and connect the payment option, you can now
        buy Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. In recent years, cryptocurrency
        exchanges have become more and more popular. It has grown exponentially
        in terms of liquidity and breadth of features. The industry that was
        previously seen as a scam or an industry with questionable practices is
        slowly turning into a legitimate industry that has attracted the
        interest of all the big investors in the financial services industry.
        Now, cryptocurrency exchanges have reached a point where they have
        almost the same level of features as their counterparts in a traditional
        brokerage. Once you find a broker and deposit your investment, you are
        ready to start buying. Cryptocurrency exchanges today offer a number of
        order types and investment methods. Almost all cryptocurrency exchanges
        offer both market orders and limit orders, and some also offer stop-loss
        orders. Among the exchanges mentioned above, eToro offers the most order
        types. eToro allows market orders, limit, stop loss, stop limit, take
        profit and take profit *When you buy cryptocurrencies on the eToro
        platform, you own the assets. The only trading fees that eToro charges
        are the spreads. That is, there are no swaps fees. Cryptocurrencies can
        be transferred from the eToro platform to the eToro wallet. But it is
        better to keep them inside the platform if the goal of your trading is
        to take advantage of the high prices to sell in the future. Those who
        send to the wallet are usually those who want to use cryptocurrencies as
        a payment method.
      </p>
      <h2>How to sell ethereum</h2>
      <p>
        You can sell Ether at the same places where you purchased the
        cryptocurrency, such as cryptocurrency exchanges, or individually. The
        process of selling ether on these platforms is usually the same as
        buying cryptocurrency. For example, you may just be asked to click a
        button and select an order type (i.e. whether you want to sell the
        cryptocurrency immediately at the available prices or whether it should
        be sold to limit losses) to make the sale. Exchanges generally have
        daily and monthly withdrawal limits. Therefore, cash from a big sale may
        not be immediately available to the trader. However, there are no limits
        on how much cryptocurrency you can sell.
