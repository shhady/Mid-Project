        What is the secret of the success of traders in the financial markets?
      </h2>
      <p>
        Trading requires several types of technical analysis to anticipate the
        trend and manage your capital. In this article, we will discuss the most
        important types of technical indicators. *By clicking on start trading,
        you will enter one of the best licensed and trusted platforms that
        provide free demo accounts and that enables you to use technical
        indicators. There are four main types of technical indicators: trend
        tracking, oscillations, volatility and support/resistance. They are
        grouped based on their function, which ranges from revealing the average
        price of a currency pair over time, to providing a clearer picture of
        support and resistance levels.
      </p>
      <h3>1. Trend indicators</h3>
      <p>
        Trend following indicators were created to assist traders in trading
        currency pairs that are trending up or down. We've all heard the phrase
        “the trend is your friend” – these indicators can help identify a trend
        and can tell us if a trend really exists.
      </p>
      <h4>moving average indicator</h4>
      <p>
        A moving average (MA) is a technical tool that measures the average
        price over a period of time. The calming effect on the chart helps give
        a clearer indication of which direction the pair is moving – either up,
        down or sideways. There are a variety of moving averages to choose from,
        with simple moving averages and sophisticated moving averages.
      </p>
      <h4>Ichimoku indicator</h4>
      <p>
        Ichimoku is a complex-looking directional assistant that is simpler than
        it looks. This Japanese indicator was created to be a standalone
        indicator that shows current trends, displays support/resistance levels,
        and indicates a possible trend reversal.
      </p>
      <h4>ADX indicator</h4>
      <p>
        The average trend indicator will not tell you whether the price is
        trending up or down, but it will tell you whether the price is trending
        or grading. This makes it the perfect candidate for either a range or
        trend strategy by making sure that you are trading based on current
        market conditions.
      </p>
      <h3>2. Oscillators</h3>
      <p>
        Oscillations give traders an idea of ​​how momentum is developing in a
        particular currency pair. When the price goes up, the oscillators move
        higher. When the price goes down, the oscillators move down. When the
        oscillators reach an extreme level, it may be time to look for price to
        return to the mean. However, just because the oscillator is reaching
        “overbought” or “oversold” levels does not mean that we should try to
        call a top or bottom. Oscillators can stay at extreme levels for a long
        time, so we need to wait for a valid signal before trading.
      </p>
      <h4>RSI indicator</h4>
      <p>
        The RSI is arguably the most popular oscillator to use. A big component
        of its formula is the ratio between average profit and average loss over
        the last 14 periods. The RSI ranges between 0-100 and is considered
        overbought above 70 and oversold below 30. Traders generally look to
        sell when 70 is exceeded from above and to buy when above 30 from below.
        Register your details and we will contact you to find out a better way
        to use the RSI to indicate when to make a forex trade.
      </p>
      <h4>Stochastic indicator</h4>
      <p>
        Stochastics offer traders a different way of calculating price
        fluctuations by tracking how far the current price is from the lowest
        low of the last X number of periods. This distance is then divided by
        the difference between the high price and the low price during the same
        number of periods. The generated line, %K, is then used to create a
        moving average, %D, which is placed directly on %K.
      </p>
      <h4>CCI Index</h4>
      <p>
        The Commodity Channel Index differs from many oscillators in that there
        is no limit to how high or low it can go. 0 is used as a central line
        with overbought and oversold levels starting at +100 and -100. Traders
        look to sell the break below +100 and buy breaks above -100.
      </p>
      <h4>MACD indicator</h4>
      <p>
        The Moving Average (Convergence / Divergence) tracks the difference
        between the two EMA lines, the 12 EMA and the 26 EMA. Then the
        difference between the two EMAs is plotted on a sub-chart (called the
        MACD line) with the 9 EMA drawn directly above it (called the signal
        line). Traders then look to buy when the MACD line crosses above the
        signal line and look to sell when the MACD line crosses below the signal
        line as shown. There are also opportunities to trade the divergence
        between the MACD and the price.
      </p>
      <h3>3. Volatility indicators</h3>
      <p>
        Volatility measures the magnitude of the highs and lows of a particular
        currency pair. When the price of a currency fluctuates significantly up
        and down, high volatility is said. Whereas a currency pair that does not
        fluctuate much is said to have low volatility. It is important to note
        how volatile a currency pair is before opening a trade, so we can take
        this into account when choosing our trading volume, stop and limit
        levels.
      </p>
      <h4>Bollinger Bands® indicator</h4>
      <p>
        Bollinger Bands ® print three lines directly above the price chart. The
        middle "band" is a 20-period simple moving average with an upper and
        lower "band" plotted by two standard deviations above and below the 20
        MA. This means that the more volatile the pair, the wider the outer
        bands become, giving Bollinger Bands® the ability to be used globally
        across currency pairs regardless of their behaviour. Bollinger Bands®
        are a registered trademark of John Bollinger Corporation.
      </p>
      <h4>ATR indicator</h4>
      <p>
        The Average True Range tells us the average distance between the high
        price and the low price over the last specified number of bars (usually
        14). This indicator is presented in pips where the higher the ATR, the
        higher the volatility of the pair and vice versa. This makes it an ideal
        tool for measuring volatility.
      </p>
      <h3>4. Support/Resistance Indicators</h3>
      <p>
        Support and resistance are key to technical analysis. The concept refers
        to the price levels on the charts that form barriers to pushing the
        price of an asset in a particular direction. For more information, see
        our article on identifying support and resistance and be sure to
        consider the indicators.
      </p>
      <h4>pivot points</h4>
      <p>
        Pivot points are some of the most widely used in all markets including
        stocks, commodities and forex. They are created using a formula made up
        of the high, low, and close prices of the previous period. Traders use
        these lines as potential support and resistance levels, levels that the
        price may have difficulty breaking through.
      </p>
      <h4>Donchian channels</h4>
      <p>
        Price channels or Donchian channels are lines above and below recent
        price action that show high and low prices over a long period of time.
        These lines can then act as support or resistance if the price comes
        into contact with them again.
