      <h2>What is the stock market?</h2>
      <p>
        Stock market refers to the set of markets and exchanges where the normal
        activities of buying, selling and issuing shares of publicly owned
        companies take place. These financial activities are conducted through
        formal institutional exchanges or over-the-counter (OTC) markets that
        operate under a specific set of regulations. There can be many stock
        trading venues in a country or region that allow transactions in stocks
        and other forms of securities. While both terms — stock market and stock
        exchange — are used interchangeably, the latter is generally a subset of
        the former. If someone says that he trades in the stock market, this
        means that he buys and sells shares on one (or more) exchanges that are
        part of the overall stock market. The leading exchanges in the US
        include the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), Nasdaq and the Chicago Board
        Options Exchange (CBOE). These leading national stock exchanges, along
        with many others operating in the country, make up the stock market in
        the United States. Although it is called the stock market or stock
        market and is primarily known for trading stocks, other securities —
        such as exchange-traded funds (ETFs), corporate bonds, stock-based
        derivatives, commodities, currencies, and bonds — are also traded in
        stock markets.

      <h2>Understand how the stock market works:</h2>
      <p>
        While today it is possible to buy almost everything online, there is
        usually a dedicated market for each commodity. For example, people drive
        to the outskirts of town and farmland to buy Christmas trees, visit the
        local lumber market to buy lumber and other necessary items for home
        furnishing and renovations, and go to stores like Walmart for regular
        groceries. These dedicated markets act as a platform where multiple
        buyers and sellers meet, interact and transact. Since the number of
        market participants is huge, one is guaranteed a fair price. For
        example, if there is only one seller of Christmas trees in the whole
        city, he will be free to charge whatever price he pleases as the buyers
        will have nowhere else to go. If the number of tree sellers is large in
        a common market, they will have to compete with each other to attract
        buyers. Buyers will be spoiled for choice with low or optimum pricing
        which makes it a fair market with price transparency. Even while
        shopping online, buyers compare the prices offered by different sellers
        on the same shopping portal or through different portals to get the best
        deals, forcing the various online sellers to offer the best prices. The
        stock market is a similar market dedicated to trading different types of
        securities in a controlled, secure and managed environment. Since the
        stock market brings together hundreds of thousands of market
        participants who want to buy and sell shares, it ensures fair pricing
        practices and transparency in transactions. Whereas earlier stock
        markets used to issue and handle paper physical stock certificates,
        modern computer-aided stock markets operate electronically.

        In short, stock exchanges provide a safe and orderly environment where
        market participants can deal in stocks and other qualified financial
        instruments with confidence with low operational risk. Stock markets
        operate under the established rules as stipulated by the regulator, and
        operate as primary and secondary markets. As a primary market, the stock
        market allows companies to issue and sell their shares to the general
        public for the first time through the initial public offering (IPO)
        process. This activity helps companies to raise the necessary capital
        from investors. Essentially, this means that the company divides itself
        into a number of shares (say 20 million shares) and sells a portion of
        those shares (say, 5 million shares) to the common public at a price (at
        For example, $10 per share). To facilitate this process, the company
        needs a market where these shares can be sold. This market is provided
        by the stock market. If all goes according to plans, the company will
        successfully sell 5 million shares at $10 each and raise $50 million in
        funds. Investors will receive shares of the company that they can expect
        to hold for their preferred term, in anticipation of a rise in the share
        price and any potential income in the form of dividend payments. The
        exchange acts as a facilitator for this capital increase process and
        receives fees for its services from the company and its financial
        partners. After the IPO process for the issuance of shares for the first
        time called the listing process, the exchange also acts as a trading
        platform that facilitates the regular buying and selling of listed
        shares. This constitutes the secondary market. The exchange receives a
        fee for every trade that occurs on its platform during secondary market
        activity. The exchange is responsible for ensuring price transparency,
        liquidity, price discovery and fair dealings in such trading activities.
        Since almost all major stock markets around the world now operate
        electronically, the exchange maintains trading systems that efficiently
        manage buy and sell orders from various market participants. They
        perform the price matching function to facilitate trade execution at a
        fair price for both buyers and sellers. A listed company may also offer
        new and additional shares through other offerings at a later stage, such
        as a rights issue or through follow-up offers. They can even buy back or
        write off their shares. The exchange facilitates such transactions. The
        exchange often creates and maintains various market-wide and
        sector-specific indices, such as the S&P 500 or the Nasdaq 100, which
        provide a barometer for tracking the movement of the market as a whole.
        The exchanges also keep all company news and announcements
