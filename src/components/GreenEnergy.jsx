      <h1>GreenEnergy</h1>
      <p>
        The energy sector is one of the most important sectors in the world.
        Energy lights and heats our homes, boosts our industries, saves lives
        and is one of the foundations of life for human society. The energy
        sector has always been a part of the world of trade and investment, and
        the shift to cleaner ways to produce sustainable energy brings with it
        new investment opportunities. As the damage to the environment becomes
        apparent, the realization is that humanity must switch to cleaner energy
        sources. The need for clean energy is so important that giants of the
        fuel and coal industries are looking for new forms of alternative energy
        production. Veteran companies and start-ups both contribute to the shift
        towards a cleaner future â€“ and in today's world it must be both
        financially profitable as well as environmentally friendly.

      <h2>Investing in energy companies</h2>
      <p>
        An increasing number of energy giants are investing in this field to try
        to maintain a foothold in the market. Moreover, given the dependence of
        these companies on coal and fuel, they are not ignorant of the fact that
        these are limited resources. Various companies are also benefiting from
        green energy, as more than $4 billion was invested in clean technology
        in 2018, and huge companies like Amazon and Google have invested in
        alternative energy.
