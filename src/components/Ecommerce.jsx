      <h1>E-commerce</h1>
      <p>
        E-commerce is a term used to describe any transaction that takes place
        over the Internet. It involves selling goods and exchanging services.

      <h2>Investing in e-commerce</h2>
      <p>
        {" "}
        Of course, the growth of e-commerce creates some amazing opportunities
        for investors. Just look at the rise in Amazon's stock price since the
        company's IPO. However, it is important to realize that not all
        e-commerce works like Amazon. The e-commerce industry is highly
        competitive, which means that there will be winners and losers. If you
        are looking to invest in the e-commerce industry, the most sensible way
        is to spread your investment across a number of different companies. In
        this way, you will reduce the risk by investing in a specific company.

      <h2>E-commerce market growth</h2>
      <p>
        Since the founding of companies like ebay and amazon, e-commerce has
        grown exponentially. Today, nearly two billion people worldwide buy
        products and services online, with sales of more than $3 trillion
        globally. However, there is still huge potential for growth despite the
        prolific rise in e-commerce sales in recent years. Online sales still
        represent only about 15% of total retail sales globally, which means
        that e-commerce sales are likely to grow a lot in the coming years.
