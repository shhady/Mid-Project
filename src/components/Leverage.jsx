      <h3>What is the leverage?</h3>
      <p>
        Financial leverage results from the use of borrowed capital as a source
        of financing. Leverage is an investment strategy for using borrowed
        money - specifically, the use of various financial instruments or
        borrowed capital - to increase the potential return on an investment.
        Leverage can also refer to the amount of debt a company is using to fund
        assets.

      <h2>Understanding Leverage:</h2>
      <p>
        Leverage is the use of debt (borrowed capital) in order to make an
        investment or project. The result is a doubling of the potential returns
        from the project. At the same time, the leverage will also multiply the
        potential downside risk in the event that the investment is
        unsuccessful. When one refers to a company, property, or investment as
        "highly leveraged," it means that the item has more debt than equity.
        Both investors and companies use the concept of leverage. Investors use
        leverage to significantly increase the returns that can be provided on
        the investment. They leverage their investments using various
        instruments, including options, futures and margin accounts. Companies
        can use leverage to fund their assets. In other words, instead of
        issuing stock to raise capital, companies can use debt financing to
        invest in business operations in an effort to increase shareholder
        value. Investors who are not comfortable using leverage directly have a
        variety of ways to access leverage indirectly. They can invest in
        companies that use leverage in the normal course of their business to
        finance or expand operations â€“ without increasing their expenses.

      <h2>Leverage Cons:</h2>
      <p>
        Leverage is a complex, multifaceted tool. The theory sounds great, and
        in fact, using leverage can be profitable, but the opposite is also
        true. Leverage magnifies both gains and losses. If the investor uses
        leverage to make an investment and the investment moves against the
        investor, his loss is much greater than if he had not benefited from the
        investment. For this reason, leverage should often be avoided by first
        time investors until they get more experience to avoid the higher risk
        of using leverage.
