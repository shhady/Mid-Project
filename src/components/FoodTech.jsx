        The way the world currently produces food urgently needs to change, and
        technology will play a major role in transforming this industry. This
        will likely create a wide range of opportunities for early-stage
        investors. Of course, the transformation of the food industry is likely
        to create a number of attractive opportunities for investors. The
        success of Beyond Meat, a maker of plant-based meat products, is a prime
        example. There will likely be a lot of investment opportunities in the
        coming years. Already, some of the world's largest investors are making
        money in this sector. Meanwhile, some of the world's richest individuals
        such as Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates have also invested in this industry.

      <h2>How to invest in the food industry</h2>
      <p>
        For private investors, there are challenges to investing in agri-food
        technology. For a start, there are many different sub-sectors within the
        topic. Do you invest in agricultural start-ups developing innovative
        digital solutions for farmers, gene-editing companies making new foods,
        or online food delivery companies that are changing the way food is
        ordered? Another complement is that there are hundreds of agri-food
        technology stocks listed around the world, and they all face a variety
        of risks, depending on their place in the food ecosystem. Of course,
        some stocks will turn out to be better investments than others. The most
        sensible approach to investing in this industry is to have a diversified
        portfolio that covers a range of sub-sectors, eliminating the risk of
        declining company performance affecting investment returns.
