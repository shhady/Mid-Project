      <h1>Technical Analysis</h1>
      <p>
        Technical analysis is the framework in which traders study price action.
        The theory is that anyone can look at historical price movements and
        determine current trading conditions and potential price action. A
        person who uses technical analysis is called a technical analyst.
        Traders who use technical analysis are known as technical traders. The
        main guide to using technical analysis is that, in theory, all current
        market information is reflected in price. Technical traders are
        generally credited with believing that "it's all in the charts!". This
        simply means that all known basic information is priced at the current
        market price. Price Chart: If the price reflects all the information out
        there, the price action is all one really needs to make a trade.
        Technical analysis looks at the rhythm, flow, and trends of price
        action. Now, have you ever heard the old adage, “History tends to repeat
        itself”? Well, that's basically what technical analysis is all about! If
        a certain price has been held as a major support or resistance level in
        the past, then traders will monitor it and establish their trades around
        that historical price level. Technical analysts look for similar
        patterns formed in the past and will form trading ideas believing that
        the price can behave the same way it did before. Technical analysis is
        not so much about prediction as it is about probability.

        Technical analysis is the study of historical price action in order to
        identify patterns and determine the possibilities for the future
        direction of the price.

        <b>So how does one "study historical price action"? </b> In the world of
        trading, when someone says “technical analysis,” the first thing that
        comes to mind is charting. Technical analysts use charts because they
        are the easiest way to visualize historical data Technical analysts
        live, eat and breathe charts which is why they are often called
        cartographers. You can look at past data to help you spot trends and
        patterns that can help you find some great trading opportunities. What's
        more is that with all the traders that rely on technical analysis out
        there, these price patterns and indicator signals tend to be
        self-fulfilling. As more and more forex traders are looking for certain
        price levels and chart patterns, these patterns are more likely to
        appear in the markets. You should know though that technical analysis is
        very subjective. Just because Donatello and Raphael are looking at the
        exact same chart setup or indicators doesn't mean they'll come up with
        the same idea about where the price might go. The important thing is
        that you understand the concepts in technical analysis so you don't
        panic when someone starts talking about Fibonacci, Bollinger Bands or
        pivot points. Don't worry yourself too much. After completing the
        Trading Academy, you will be just like them
