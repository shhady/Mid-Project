      <h1>Editing Genomes</h1>
      <p>
        Billed as one of the biggest medical advances ever, CRISPR
        (gene-editing) technology appears to be an absolute game-changer in
        medicine. Those who invest early can make big profits. Some analysts
        have even said that investing in gene-editing technology now could be
        akin to investing in antibiotic development or X-ray technology in the
        early 20th century.
      </p>
      <h2>Companies investing in gene editing</h2>
      <p>
        Already, the big drug companies have moved to seize a piece of the
        action, For example, in 2015, Novartis signed deals with both intellia
        and Caribou Biosciences, while AstraZeneca signed deals with the
        Wellcome Trust Sanger Institution, the gene-editing initiative, and
        Themo Fisher Scientific. Ventures, financiers, and philanthropists have
        invested in technology too, adviser Bill Gates Head of Science and
        Technology, Boris Nikolic, and a team of prominent funders who invested
        $120 million in biotechnology focused on CRISPR Editas Medicine in 2015.
        However, investing in this type of niche technology is not always easy.
        Profits can be elusive and there can be a lot of setbacks. Lack of
        liquidity can be disastrous. Therefore, choosing the right stocks can be
        a difficult process. With this in mind, Crispr-Tech has developed a
        proprietary portfolio - a fully customized objective investment strategy
        focused on the gene modification market - to help clients gain
        diversified exposure to this exciting industry. With this portfolio,
        investors can invest in the fragile industry by gaining exposure to a
        diversified portfolio of leading gene-editing companies, including
        stocks such as Editas Medicine, Intellia Therapeutics, and Sangamo
        Therapeutics.

      <h2>The effect of CRISPR technology</h2>
      <p>
        The potential of CRISPR is amazing, and not only could the technology
        change healthcare forever by removing certain genes from our genetic
        code and eradicating every disease known to man, but it could also have
        a powerful impact across a wide range of other industries, including
        agricultural energy. and alternative. Of course, such a powerful new
        technology is likely to create compelling opportunities for investors.
