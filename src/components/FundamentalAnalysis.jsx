      <h1>Fundamental Analysis</h1>
      <p>
        While technical analysis is based on charts to identify patterns or
        trends, fundamental analysis is based on economic data reports and news
        headlines. Fundamental analysis is a way of looking at the market by
        analyzing the economic, social and political forces that may affect
        market prices. If you think about it, it makes a lot of sense! Just as
        in economic categories, it is supply and demand that determines the
        price, It's easy to use supply and demand as an indicator of where the
        price might be headed. The difficult part is to analyze all the factors
        that affect supply and demand. In other words, you have to look at
        various factors to determine the economy of who is good, and the economy
        of who is bad. You have to understand the reasons and how certain events
        such as an increase in the unemployment rate affect a country's economy
        and monetary policy that ultimately affects the level of demand and
        supply The idea behind this type of analysis is that if a country's
        current or future economic outlook is good, its currency should
        strengthen The better a country's economy is, the more foreign companies
        and foreign investors invest in that country. This results in the need
        to purchase that country's currency to obtain those assets. In short,
        this is the basic analysis: For example, suppose the US dollar is
        gaining strength due to the improvement of the US economy. As the
        economy improves, higher interest rates may be needed to control growth
        and inflation. Higher interest rates make dollar-denominated financial
        assets more attractive. In order to get these assets, traders and
        investors have to buy some green coins first. This increases the demand
        for the currency. As a result, the value of the US dollar is likely to
        rise against other currencies with lower demand Later in the tutorials,
        you'll learn about the economic data points that tend to drive currency
        rates, and why they do so. You will know who the Fed chair is and how
        the retail sales data reflects the economy. Global interest rates will
        lose. To be able to use fundamental analysis, it is necessary to
        understand how economic, financial and political news affects currency
        exchange rates. This requires a good understanding of macroeconomics and
        geopolitics. No need to be intimidated by such words. For now, just know
        that fundamental analysis is a way of analyzing the likely movements of
        a currency through the strength or weakness of the economic outlook for
        a particular country.
