      <h2>What are investment portfolios or investment funds?</h2>
      <p>
        An investment fund is a type of financial instrument that consists of a
        group of stocks and other assets. Mutual funds are operated by
        professional money managers, who allocate the fund's assets and attempt
        to generate capital and income gains for the fund's investors. The
        investment fund's portfolio is organized and maintained to match the
        investment objectives stated in its prospectus. Mutual funds give small
        or individual investors access to professionally managed portfolios of
        stocks and other securities. Thus, each shareholder contributes
        proportionately to the profits or losses of the fund. Mutual funds
        invest in a large number of securities to distribute and diversify the
        investment with the aim of reducing risk, and performance is usually
        tracked like the change in the total market value of the fund - which is
        derived from the overall performance of the underlying investments.
      </p>
      <h2>Main Points</h2>
      <p>
        1. An investment fund is a type of investment vehicle that consists of a
        portfolio of stocks or other securities. Mutual funds give small or
        individual investors access to diversified, professionally managed
        portfolios at a low price.
        <br />
        2. Investment funds are divided into several types of categories,
        representing the types of securities they invest in, their investment
        objectives, and the type of returns they seek.
        <br />
        3. Investment funds aim to reduce risks in the long run
      </p>
      <h4>
        In general, investment portfolios are built according to specific
        sectors, and it consists of the shares of the leading companies in each
        sector, and each asset is weighted according to the total market value.
        <br />
        Investment in investment portfolios begins by choosing the sector in
        which the investor is concerned and by choosing the available investment
        amount. Profits in general are proportional to the capital.
      </h4>
      <h3>Investors usually earn a return on a mutual fund in three ways:</h3>
      <p>
        1. Income is realized from dividends on the shares in the investment
        portfolio. The fund pays nearly all of the income it receives over the
        course of the year to the asset owners in the form of a dividend. Funds
        often give investors a choice to either receive dividends or to reinvest
        the profits and get more shares.
        <br />
        2. If the fund sells securities whose prices have increased or
        rebalances, then the fund has capital gains. Most funds also pass these
        gains on to distribution investors.
        <br />
        3. If the holdings of the fund increase in price but are not sold by the
        fund manager, then the price of the fund shares increases. You can then
        sell the shares of your mutual fund to make a profit in the market.
      </p>
      <h2>Evaluate previous results</h2>
      <p>
        As with all investments, it is important to research the fund's past
        results. To this end, here is a list of questions potential investors
        should ask themselves when reviewing the fund's history:
        <br />
        1. Has the fund manager achieved results consistent with the general
        market returns?
        <br /> 2. Was the fund more volatile than the main indicators?
        <br />
        3. Was there an unusually high rate of volatility that would impose tax
        costs and liabilities on investors? The answers to these questions will
        give you insight into how a portfolio manager performs under certain
        conditions, and show the fund's historical trend in terms of volatility
        and return. <br /> Before purchasing any fund, it makes sense to review
        the results of the investment fund. A fund's prospectus should give you
        an idea of ​​the fund's prospects and holdings in the coming years.
        There should also be a discussion about general industry and market
        trends that may affect the fund's performance.
      </p>
      <h2>Pros of mutual funds</h2>
      <p>
        There are a variety of reasons that have made mutual funds a preferred
        vehicle for investors for decades. Which:
      </p>
      <h3>Professional capital management</h3>
      <p>
        The main advantage of mutual funds is that you don't have to pick stocks
        and manage investments. Instead, a professional investment manager takes
        care of all this using careful research and skillful trading. Investors
        buy funds because they often do not have the time or experience to
        manage their own portfolios, or because they do not have access to the
        same type of information that an investment manager has. An investment
        fund is a relatively inexpensive way for a small investor to get a
        dedicated manager to make and monitor investments. Most private and
        non-institutional money managers deal only with high net worth
        individuals - people who have at least six figures to invest. However,
        mutual funds, as noted above, require a much lower minimum investment.
        Therefore, these funds offer a low-cost way for individual investors to
        try and hope you can benefit from professional money management.
      </p>
      <h3>Distribution and diversification</h3>
      <p>
        Diversification, or mixing investments and assets within a portfolio to
        reduce risk, is one of the advantages of investing in mutual funds.
        Experts advocate diversification as a way to boost portfolio returns,
        while reducing its risks. For example, the portfolio provides shares of
        different companies to enhance diversification. Buying an investment
        fund can achieve diversification cheaper and faster than buying
        individual securities. Large mutual funds usually own hundreds of
        different stocks in many different industries. It would not be practical
        for an investor to build this type of portfolio with a small amount of
        money.
      </p>
      <h3>Ease of entry</h3>
      <p>
        Trading on major stock exchanges, mutual funds can be bought and sold
        with relative ease, making them highly liquid investments. Also, when it
        comes to certain types of assets, such as foreign stocks or exotic
        commodities, mutual funds are often the most feasible way - in fact,
        sometimes the only way - for individual investors to participate.
      </p>
      <h3>Transparency</h3>
      <p>
        Mutual funds are subject to regulatory bodies that ensure accountability
        and fairness to investors.
