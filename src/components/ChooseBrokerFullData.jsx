      <h2>choose a broker</h2>
      <p>
        The financial markets are so competitive that the mere thought of having
        to scrutinize all the brokers available can get you in big trouble.
        Choosing the broker you want to trade with can be a very daunting task
        especially if you don't know what to look for In this section, we will
        discuss the qualities you should look for when choosing a financial
        broker
      </p>
      <h3>Regulation</h3>
      <p>
        The first and most important advantage that a good broker should have is
        a high level of security. After all, you're not going to hand thousands
        of dollars to someone who simply claims to be legit, are you?
        Fortunately, checking the credibility of a forex broker is not too
        difficult. There are regulatory bodies all over the world that separate
        the trustworthy from the fraudulent. Below is a list of countries with
        their corresponding regulatory bodies:
      </p>
      <p>
        {" "}
        <b>United States</b>: National Futures Association (NFA) and Commodity
        Futures Trading Commission (CFTC)
        <br /> <b>United Kingdom</b>: Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and
        Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) <br />
        <b>Australia</b>: Australian Securities and Investment Commission (ASIC)
        <br />
        <b> Switzerland</b>: Swiss Federal Banking Commission (SFBC)
        <br /> <b>Germany</b>: Bundesanstalt für Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht
        (BaFIN)
        <br /> <b>France</b>: Autorité des Marchés Financiers (AMF) <br />
        <b>Canada</b>: Investment Information Regulatory Organization of Canada
        (IIROC) <br />
        <b>Cyprus</b>: Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission (Cysec)
      </p>
      <h3>Transaction costs</h3>
      <p>
        No matter what type of broker you are with, whether you like it or not,
        you will always be subject to transaction costs. Every time you enter a
        trade, you will have to pay either the spread or the commission, so it
        is normal to look for the cheapest and least expensive rates. Sometimes
        you may need to sacrifice low transactions for a more reliable broker.
        Make sure you know if you need tight spreads for your type of trade, and
        then review your options. It's all about finding the right balance
        between security and low transaction costs.
      </p>
      <h3>Deposit and Withdrawal</h3>
      <p>
        Good brokers should allow you to deposit money and withdraw your profits
        without a hassle. Brokers really don't have a reason to make it
        difficult for you to withdraw your profits because the only reason they
        keep your money is to facilitate trading. Your broker only keeps your
        money to facilitate trading, so there is no reason for you to have a
        hard time getting the profits you made. The broker must make sure that
        the withdrawal process is fast and smooth.
      </p>
      <h3>Trading platform</h3>
      <p>
        In the field of online trading, most of the trading activity takes place
        through the brokers' trading platform. This means that the broker's
        trading platform should be easy to use and stable. When looking for a
        broker, always check what their trading platform has to offer. Do you
        offer a free news feed? How about easy-to-use technical and charting
        tools? Does it give you all the information you will need to trade
        properly?
      </p>
      <h3>Execution</h3>
      <p>
        It is essential that your broker provides you with the best possible
        price for your orders. Under normal market conditions (for example,
        normal liquidity, lack of important news releases or sudden events),
        there is really no reason why your broker should not fill you at the
        market price you see when you click on the "buy" button or very close to
        the "buy" button. Sale". For example, assuming you have a stable
        internet connection, if you click 'buy' EUR/USD for 1.3000, that price
        should be filled in or within small pips of it. The speed with which
        your orders are executed is very important, especially if you are a
        speculator. A price difference of just a few pips can make this trade
        more difficult to win
      </p>
      <h3>Customer Service</h3>
      <p>
        Brokers are not perfect and therefore you should choose a broker that
        you can easily contact when problems arise. The brokers' efficiency when
        dealing with account issues or technical support is just as important as
        their performance in executing trades. Brokers may be nice and helpful
        during the account opening process but they have terrible “post-login”
        support.
      </p>
      <h3>Educational courses</h3>
      <p>
        Since each broker has its own platform and its own terms and conditions,
        it is important to have educational and training courses to educate and
        guide investors.
