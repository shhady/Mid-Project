      <h2>What is foreign exchange (Forex)?</h2>
      <p>
        Foreign exchange (Forex) is the trading of one currency for another. For
        example, one can exchange US dollars for Euros. Foreign exchange
        transactions can be conducted in the foreign exchange market, also known
        as the forex market. The forex market is the largest and most liquid
        market in the world, with trillions of dollars being traded every day,
        and there is no central location. Instead, the forex market is an
        electronic network of banks, brokers, institutions and individual
        traders (they mostly trade through brokers or banks).

      <h2>Trading in the foreign exchange market</h2>
      <p>
        The market is open 24 hours a day, five days a week across major
        financial centers around the world. This means that you can buy or sell
        currencies at any time during the day. The foreign exchange market is
        not exactly a one stop shop. There are a variety of different ways an
        investor can go through in order to execute forex trades. You can go
        through different merchants or through different financial centers that
        use a combination of electronic networks. From a historical point of
        view, foreign exchange was once a concept for governments, large
        corporations, and hedge funds. But in today's world, currency trading is
        as easy as a click of a mouse – and accessibility is not an issue, which
        means anyone can do it. In fact, many investment firms offer the
        opportunity for individuals to open accounts and trade currencies
        however and whenever they choose. When you make transactions in the
        forex market, you are buying or selling the currency of a particular
        country. But there is no actual exchange of money from one hand to
        another. This is contrary to what happens in a foreign exchange kiosk –
        In the world of electronic markets, traders usually take a position in a
        particular currency, hoping that there will be some upside movement and
        strength in the currency they are buying (or weakening if they are
        selling) so that they can make a profit.
