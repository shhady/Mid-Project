      <p>
        Fibonacci retracements are popular among technical traders. They are
        based on the basic numbers identified by the 13th century mathematician
        Leonardo Fibonacci. The sequence of Fibonacci numbers is not as
        important as the mathematical relationships, expressed in ratios,
        between the numbers in the series. In technical analysis, a Fibonacci
        retracement is created by taking two extreme points (usually a top and a
        bottom) on a stock chart and dividing the vertical distance by the key
        Fibonacci ratios of 23.6%, 38.2%, 50%, 61.8%, and 100%. Once these
        levels are identified, horizontal lines are drawn and used to identify
        potential support and resistance levels.

        For unknown reasons, these Fibonacci ratios seem to play a role in the
        stock market, just as they do in nature. Technical traders try to use
        them to identify critical points where asset price momentum is likely to
        reverse. Fibonacci retracements are the most used of all Fibonacci
        trading tools. This is partly due to its relative simplicity and partly
        due to its applicability to almost any trading instrument. They can be
        used to draw support lines, identify resistance levels, place stop-loss
        orders, and set target prices. Fibonacci ratios can act as a basic
        mechanism in a counter trend trading strategy. Fibonacci levels are
        horizontal lines that indicate the likely locations of support and
        resistance levels. Each level is associated with one of the above
        mentioned percentages or percentages. It shows how much of the previous
        movement the price bounced back. The trend of the previous trend is
        likely to continue. However, the price of the asset usually falls back
        to one of the above ratios before this happens. The following chart
        shows how the Fibonacci retracement appears. Most modern trading
        platforms have a tool that draws horizontal lines automatically. Notice
        how the price changes direction when it approaches support and
        resistance levels.
