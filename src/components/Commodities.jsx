      <h1>Commodities</h1>
      <p>
        The commodities traded are usually classified into four main categories:
        minerals, energy, livestock and meat, and agriculture. For investors,
        commodity trading is an important way to diversify their portfolio
        beyond traditional securities. In the most basic sense, commodities are
        known to be risky investment propositions because their market (supply
        and demand) is affected by uncertainties that are difficult to predict,
        such as unusual weather patterns, epidemics, and natural and man-made
        disasters. . There are a number of ways to invest in commodities, such
        as futures, options, and exchange-traded funds In a broad sense, the
        basic principles of supply and demand are what drive commodity markets.
        Changes in supply affect demand; Lower supply means higher prices.
        Therefore, any major disturbances in the supply of a commodity, such as
        a large-scale health problem affecting livestock, can lead to a rise in
        the generally stable and expected demand for livestock. Global economic
        development and technological progress can also affect prices. For
        example, the emergence of China and India as major players in
        manufacturing (and thus the demand for a greater volume of industrial
        minerals) has contributed to the lower availability of metals, such as
        steel, for the rest of the world.

      <h3>Kinds of goods</h3>
      <p>
        The commodities traded are classified into four main categories:
        minerals, energy, livestock and meat, and agriculture.
      </p>
      <h4>Metal</h4>
      <p>
        Metal commodities include gold, silver, platinum and copper. During
        periods of market volatility or bear markets, some investors may decide
        to invest in precious metals - especially gold - due to its status as a
        reliable and dependable metal with real transferable value. Investors
        may also decide to invest in precious metals as a hedge against periods
        of high inflation or currency depreciation.
      </p>
      <h4>Energy</h4>
      <p>
        Energy commodities include crude oil, heating oil, natural gas, and
        gasoline. Global economic developments and reduced oil production from
        existing oil wells around the world have historically led to higher oil
        prices, as demand for energy-related products has risen at the same time
        as oil supplies have dwindled. Investors interested in entering the
        commodity market in the energy sector should also be aware of the extent
        of the economic downturn, any production shifts imposed by the
        Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), new technological
        developments in alternative energy sources (wind energy), solar energy,
        biofuels, etc.) which aims to replace crude oil as the primary source of
        energy, can have a significant impact on market prices of commodities in
        the energy sector.
      </p>
      <h4>Cattle and Meat</h4>
      <p>Include live livestock commodities and nutritious livestock</p>
      <h4>Agriculture</h4>
      <p>
        Agricultural commodities include corn, soybeans, wheat, rice, cocoa,
        coffee, cotton, and sugar. In the agricultural sector, grains can be
        highly volatile during the summer months or during any period of
        weather-related shifts. For investors interested in the agricultural
        sector, population growth – combined with limited agricultural supply –
        can provide opportunities to profit from rising agricultural commodity
        prices.
      </p>
      <h2>Oil trading</h2>
      <p>
        Traders have many ways to profit through oil trading. These approaches
        come with varying degrees of risk and range from direct investment in
        oil as a commodity or indirect exposure to oil through ownership of
        energy-related stocks, ETFs or options contracts. Each of these types of
        investment can be obtained through an online brokerage account, or
        directly through a broker.
      </p>
      <h3>Oil as an asset</h3>
      <p>
        Oil is an economically and strategically important resource for many
        countries due to its importance to most of the energy we consume.
        Countries like the United States hold large reserves of crude oil for
        future use. Measuring these oil reserves serves as an indicator for
        investors. Changes in oil stock levels are a reflection of production
        and consumption trends. Oil investors look for specific economic
        indicators to help them understand future movements in the petroleum
        industry. Like any commodity market, oil companies and oil futures are
        sensitive to inventory levels, production, global demand, interest rate
        policies, and aggregate economic numbers such as gross domestic product.
        Apart from supply and demand factors, another driving force for oil
        prices is that investors and speculators bid on oil futures contracts.
        Many major institutional investors now involved in the oil markets, such
        as pension funds, have commodity-linked investments as part of a
        long-term asset allocation strategy. Others, including Wall Street
        speculators, trade oil futures for very short periods of time to make
        quick profits. Some observers attribute the wide fluctuations in oil
        prices to these speculators in the short term, while others believe that
        their impact is minimal.
      </p>
      <h3>Investing in oil directly</h3>
      <p>
        One straightforward way to own oil is to buy oil futures or oil options.
        Futures contracts are highly volatile and involve a high level of risk.
        In addition, investing in futures contracts may require the investor to
        do a lot of homework. Another straightforward way to own oil is by
        buying commodity-based oil trading funds (ETFs). ETFs trade on an
        exchange and can be bought and sold in a similar way to stocks. For
        example, buying one share of the United States Oil Fund (USO) gives you
        exposure to roughly one barrel of oil. The fund's investment objective
        is to provide daily investment results corresponding to the percentage
        of daily changes in the spot price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI)
        crude oil to be delivered to Cushing, Oklahoma.

      <h3>How to trade oil</h3>
      <h3>things to focus on:</h3>
      <p>
        Crude oil trading offers excellent opportunities for profit in almost
        all market conditions due to its unique position in the global economic
        and political systems. Also, energy sector volatility has risen sharply
        in recent years, ensuring strong trends that can produce consistent
        returns for short-term swing trades and long-term timing strategies.
        Market participants often fail to take full advantage of the volatility
        of crude oil, either because they have not learned the unique
        characteristics of these markets or because they are unaware of the
        hidden pitfalls that can affect profits. In addition, not all
        energy-focused financial instruments are created equal, as a subset of
        these securities are more likely to produce positive results.

        2. Technical analysis derived from the charts.
        <br />
        3.steps to making profit in oil trading:
      </h4>
      <h5>1. Know what moves oil (fundamental analysis)</h5>
      <p>
        Crude oil moves through supply and demand forecasts, and is affected by
        global production as well as global economic prosperity. Excess supply
        and diminished demand encourage traders to sell the oil markets, while
        high demand and low or stable production encourage traders to buy oil.
        Tight convergence of positive components can produce strong bullish
        trends, such as the rise in crude oil prices to $145.31 per barrel in
        July 2008, while tight convergence of negative components can create
        equally strong downtrends, such as the August 2015 crash to $37.75 per
        barrel . Sometimes tight trading ranges are produced when conditions are
        mixed, which generates a sideways movement that can last for years.
      </p>
      <h5>2. Understanding the audience</h5>
      <p>
        The energy futures markets are dominated by professional and hedged
        traders, as hedge funds speculate on the long and short-term trend.
        Retail traders and investors exercise less influence here than in more
        emotional markets, such as precious metals or high-growth stocks. The
        retail effect rises when crude oil trends go sharply, attracting capital
        and retail traders who are drawn to these markets by front-page
        headlines and headlines. Subsequent waves of greed and fear can
        intensify the momentum of the underlying trend, contributing to
        historical peaks and crashes that print exceptionally high volume.
      </p>
      <h5>3. Technical analysis</h5>
      <p>
        Commodity trading needs technical analysis, which is the study of the
        historical price movement through the chart in order to identify
        patterns and determine the possibilities of the future direction of the
        price. With so many traders relying on technical analysis, these price
        patterns and indicator signals tend to anticipate the future direction.
        Use support and resistance lines as pivotal areas to enter or exit the
        market for better capital management. As more and more traders are
        looking for certain price levels and chart patterns, these patterns are
        more likely to appear in the markets.
      </p>
      <h2>Gold trading</h2>
      <p>
        Gold trading provides excellent opportunities to profit, whether in an
        uptrend or downtrend, due to its unique importance within the global
        economic and political systems, as well as its high liquidity. While
        many people choose to own the metal directly, speculating through the
        futures, stock and options markets provides leverage. Market
        participants succeed in taking full advantage of the fluctuations in
        gold prices when learning the unique characteristics of the global gold
        markets or the causes that lead to market movement, which enables the
        trader to reap profits. It is not difficult to learn to trade the yellow
        metal, but the activity requires a skill set for this commodity.
        Beginners should walk lightly, but seasoned investors benefit by
        incorporating the four strategic steps into their daily trading
        routines. Meanwhile, the experience reduces the complexities of trading
        gold in general.

      <h3>How to trade gold</h3>
      <h4>
        1. What are the reasons for the movement of gold? (fundamental analysis)
      </h4>
      <p>
        As a safe haven, gold has permeated deeply into the psyche of the
        financial world. Almost everyone has an opinion about the yellow metal,
        but gold itself reacts only to a limited number of price stimuli:
        <br /> economic and political evidence <br /> Inflation and deflation{" "}
        <br /> greed and fear
        <br />
        Supply and demand These forces always play a role in global markets,
        leading to both uptrends and downtrends. For example, the Federal
        Reserve (FOMC) economic stimulus that began in 2008, initially had
        little effect on gold because market traders were focused on the high
        levels of fear generated by the economic crash of 2008. However, this
        quantitative easing Encouraged deflation, which led to a reversal in the
        market for gold and a host of other commodities. This shift did not
        happen immediately because the process of deflation was under way, with
        the decline of commodity-based financial assets spiraling back towards
        historical peaks. Gold finally peaked and turned lower in 2011 after the
        deflation was completed and central banks ramped up their quantitative
        easing policies. VIX (the volatility index which is a measure of
        expected price volatility) fell to lower levels at the same time,
        indicating that fear is no longer an important market driver.
      </p>
      <h4>Study Charting (Technical Analysis)</h4>
      <p>
        Technical analysis is the study of historical price movement through a
        chart in order to identify patterns and determine the possibilities for
        the future direction of the price. With so many traders relying on
        technical analysis, these price patterns and indicator signals tend to
        anticipate the future direction. And the use of support and resistance
        lines as pivotal areas to enter or exit the market for better capital

        the markets.

      <h2>Natural gas</h2>
      <p>
        Natural gas plays a large role in the energy industry. Natural gas was
        once viewed as a by-product of oil, but it is now used in many ways,
        from residential to industrial uses to electricity generation. Natural
        gas cars are now a reality, with about 23 million natural gas cars
        worldwide. They're cleaner than fuel and better economical, contributing
        to about 32% of energy use in the US in 2019, so it's no wonder why it's
        a An alternative to other fuels. With this in mind, investors should be
        familiar with the information they need to make appropriate investment
        decisions regarding natural gas investments. By reviewing who uses
        natural gas, how it is transported, storage capabilities, pricing,
        trading methods, and spot and futures markets, investors will have the
        tools they need to better understand this clean commodity.
        <br />
        Nationally, the biggest factor affecting demand for natural gas is
        temperature. During the winter, natural gas is used for heating while
        during the summer it is often used to run air conditioners. Thus, the
        demand and price of natural gas fluctuate whether it is in summer or
        winter. During the winter, the demand is at its peak and therefore
        prices adjust accordingly.
      </p>
      <h3>Natural gas trading</h3>
      <p>
        natural gas trading. By taking a directional stance, taking advantage of
        whether the price is going up or down depending on the position being
        taken. However, since natural gas is cyclical, traders tend to speculate
        on price with spreads.
        <br /> <b>speculation</b> In this case, the investor buys natural gas
        when the price is low and sells it when the price is high. Since natural
        gas prices can be volatile even on a weekly basis, it is possible to buy
        during the period when demand is low and sell when demand is high, to
        take advantage of the fluctuations.
