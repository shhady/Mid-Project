      <h1>Support and resistance</h1>
      <p>
        The concepts of trading level support and resistance are undoubtedly two
        of the most widely discussed features of technical analysis. Part of
        analyzing chart patterns, traders use these terms to refer to price
        levels on charts that tend to act as barriers preventing an asset's
        price from being pushed in a particular direction.

      <h3>Definetion of support and resistance</h3>
      <p>
        Support is the price level at which the downtrend is expected to stop
        temporarily due to concentration of demand or interest buying. As the
        price of assets or securities decreases, the demand for shares
        increases, thus forming a support line. Meanwhile, resistance areas
        arise due to selling interest when prices are rising. Once a zone or
        'area' of support or resistance is identified, these price levels can
        act as potential entry or exit points because when the price reaches a
        point of support or resistance, it will do one of two things - bounce
        away from the support or resistance level, or violate the price level
        and continue In its direction – until it reaches the next support or
        resistance level. The timing of some trades depends on the belief that
        the support and resistance areas will not be broken. Whether the price
        is stopped by a support or resistance level, or has been breached,
        traders can “bet” on the trend and can quickly determine if it is
        correct. If the price moves in the wrong direction, the position can be
        closed with a small loss. If the price moves in the right direction, the
        movement can be significant.
